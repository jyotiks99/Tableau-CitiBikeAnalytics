<h2>Project Aim:</h2>
<p>The aim of this project was to provide insights into the Citi Bike program using Tableau. The Tableau data story displays a visual analysis of bike usage between July and December 2013. This will enable Citi officials to action the next steps to publicize and improve their city program.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

The Citi Bike data for 2013 was found on the Citi Bike Data webpage. The data includes:

<li>Trip Duration (minutes)</li>
<li>Start Time </li>
<li>Stop Time</li>
<li>Start Station Name</li>
<li>End Station Name</li>
<li>Station ID</li>
<li>Station Lat/lng</li>
<li>Bike ID</li>
<li>User Type (Customer or Subscriber)</li>
<li>Gender (unknown, male, female)</li>
<li>Age</li>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Phenomenon 1</h3>

<li>More males are shown to bike ride compared to females</li>

<p>This is a strange phenomenon as there should be a gender balance. However, previous research has shown that gender affects bike usage. For example, emerging trends show that males are more likely to use cycling as their mode of transport than females despite being among the riskiest transportation modes. A considerable body of literature has recorded that females are a more risk demographic than men, suggesting lower adoption rates in cycling. Furthermore, alternative reasons for female low cycling rates are the inability to carry children, which therefore discourages them from cycling (Krizek et al, 2005).</p>

<h3>Phenomenon 2</h3>
<li>There are no female customers, but there are female subscribers as the most common user type</li>

<p>This is a strange phenomenon despite previous evidence indicating low female cycling adoption rates.</p>

<h3>Phenomenon 3</h3>
<li>Most cyclers start & stop their journeys at 8:00 or 17:00 </li>
<img width="492" alt="starttime" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85222559/160007200-b47b5ede-4923-4cb4-997a-d1b9a03cc734.png"> <img width="491" alt="stoptime" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85222559/160007256-89781f95-93f3-45a5-ad90-4defc8af024e.png">

<p>Most workplaces start at 9:00; therefore, those that use a bike will most likely start their journey at 8:00 to allow enough time to get to work on time (especially as it is rush hour). Similarly, most people finish work at around 17:00 and therefore is a popular time to start commuting back (Krizek et al, 2005) </p>

<h3>Phenomenon 4</h3>
<li>40 is the most popular age for cycling in both males and females </li>
<img width="400" alt="age" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85222559/160007654-9a8d19bd-ac1c-4658-b8f7-83cca136575f.png">

<p>This is a strange phenomenon as people in their 40s usually indicate a decline in performance and fitness ceiling. Peak form is usually in the late 20s and early 30s, and therefore cycling is thought to target this age range demographic. However, this data indicates otherwise (Krizek et al, 2005). </p>
